# Neural Network Classification on MNIST

## Overview
This project in created to get a deeper fundemental knowledge of how to construct a neural network from the bottom. There are of course a lot existing machine learning libraries that can be easily used to develop any type of machine learning models. This project is made to get an overview of each step to fully create a Neural Network from scratch, and try to understand mechanics of how everything works.


## Features
- Classification on MNIST dandwritten digit dataset
- This will give a overview of the functional parts needed to build a simple neural network from scratch 


### TODO:
- [X] Basic Matrix operations 
    - Scalar
    - Element-wise
    - Matrix Product
    - Transpose
- [ ] Perceptron
- [ ] Forward Pass
- [ ] Backward Pass
